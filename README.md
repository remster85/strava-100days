# strava-100days
Repository to work on a challenge to play around with the strava api

## Project #1  
The first project is to build a data visualization of running activities.  
It could highlight that the runner is a week day morning kind of runner but an evening week-end kind of runner.  
Ultimately, we can also generate a label on this runner.  
A heatmap looks appropriate.  

I know for instance that I run on week-ends exclusively in the morning. I mostly workout on tuesday evenings with my club Adobo AC. I mostly race in the morning.

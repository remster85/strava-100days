# strava-100days
My 100 days of code challenge around the strava api  

Visit http://remstrava.westus.cloudapp.azure.com   :clap:


## Project #1  
The first project is to build data visualizations of running activities and learning about the microsoft azure cloud, practicing angular and using the strava api.

I have a few ideas to start with:
- See a breakdown of runs per day, per hour -> We could attempt to label the runner.
- Link a training plan with actual activity.
- Offer a chatbot that can respond questions around mileage or tips.

I know for instance that I run on week-ends exclusively in the morning. I mostly workout on tuesday evenings with my club Adobo AC. I mostly race in the morning.
